This project represents the Front-end of the Betting app.

All relevant data is stored inside JSON and retrieved via Ajax.

Underscore.js is used for rendering HTML from JSON. Rendering occurs every 10 seconds.

User can:

 - search markets by market name
 - sort markets by market name in ascending or descending order
 - sort markets by highest value odds

States of these functionalities are preserved by session storage.

I used Gulp for running various tasks (adding css prefixes, compiling Sass, Compressing Css, minifying images and syncing browser).

I also included package.json file, so you can npm install all dependencies that are required for running Gulp tasks.

You can checkout the <b>[Demo](http://betting.byethost9.com/)</b>.

Have fun! :beer:
